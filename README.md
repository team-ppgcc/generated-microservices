# generated-microservices
Microservices Generated by sp2mic


## Getting Started
1. To build and run generated-microservices applications you need to have Maven, JDK11+ and Docker. However, the simplest way to start with it is through any IDE like Intellij or Eclipse.
2. First, you have to run Consul on Docker container
```
$ docker run -d --name consul-1 -p 8500:8500 -e CONSUL_BIND_INTERFACE=eth0 consul
```
3. Then you can compile your application with Maven `mvn clean install` command and using `java -jar ...` command. Or you can just build it and run using your IDE. Each microservices is listeting on dynamically generated port.

## Architecture
Our sample microservices-based system consists of the following modules:
- **gateway** - a module that uses Spring Cloud Gateway for running Spring Boot application that acts as a proxy/gateway in our architecture.
- **orchestrator** -  a module containing the orchestrator microservices that communicates with all other microservices.
- **programa** - a module containing the sample microservices that allows to perform search operation on repository configured.
